 ---Zoe's Akechi Goro Themed Pomodoro App! (⸝⸝> ᴗ•⸝⸝)

hi im zoe and this is one of my favourite BIG projects that ive made so far! This is a Pomodoro App that we were supposedly make for our JavaScript Course's Final Project T-T 
i just couldnt stand how bland it looked! there was no way it was gonna Pomodoro on me yk? (if that is a term..) I get motivated by things that i like! or doing work or stuff with someone so that
i dont end up procastinating! so i just had to add some.. flavour to it..! sooooooo i made this AKECHI GORO PERSONA 5 INSPIRED CHILL PILL WEB APP!!!

----FEATURES!!!

- Home screen: so we have a homescreen with the the mini game logo (that i designed) with a silly and chopped character animation (that too, i made).
  we also have two volume control buttons on the top, one is for muting, unmuting and the other is the volume slider to control the volume of background music/osts however you like!

- Activity Selection Screen: then we have an activity selection screen which basically asks you what you're going to do today. study? work? or hangout? (that could be used for gaming, or your other hobbies!
  for example; ill set the hangout mode for 45mins so that i play game only for 45mins! and Akechi is alongside you! ITS A HANGOUT WOOOOO!!!)

- Timer Selection screen: yup, as the name suggests, its for selecting the duration for your session! how long you'd like to lock in. (or how long you CAN lock in) (depends bro)..
  you can either confirm your selection with the DONE button or if youre not sure about your choice like lets say u were about to select Hangout but u changed ur mind like no no im gonna study like a good person and lock in, then choose the THINK AGAIN button!
- once done, you come to the Session screen! Click start and begin your session! the timer the countdown respective to your selected duration. if your forgot to choose one, it starts the countdown from the default timer that is for 25mins!

- Session screen features: Yup, all session screens for different activities have different character animation and varying features!
  1. if you click on the character, (Or the screen in general, you'll see random generated dialogues!) (it helps to stay motivated hehehehe) (and its so fun to spam tap ehhehehehe)
  2. Breaktime and End-session, as the name suggests, one for taking break and one to end the session! And SURPRISEE THEY ARE NOT YOUR BASIC BREAK AND END SESSION EITHER! (ill tell about it in a bit..)

- BreakScreen features: just like the session screens, all break screens for different activities are different (even the dialogues are different for each screen!), the music is different for the break screens as well!
  all break sessions are for 5mins. you can take multiple breaks if you'd like. AAAND ANOTHER SURPRISE! can you see those character dialogue text-boxes? yup! they vary differently in their each way!
  if you take the break earlier than 5mins or so, the dialogue would be different (like ofc bro u just started..) and if you take if after like 10mins or so, the dialogue would be different!
  so make sure you take your breaks thoughtfully huhuhu. break session screen has 2 buttons to either end the session or continue! make sure you continue and dont run away or you'll get the bad end! continuing to the main session has different dialogues too! i would love if anyone would find it out themselves too!

- End-session: Exactly, even the ending session is special. so you get 2 endings. 1. bad end (because u didnt finish the session and forcefully ended it) 2. good end (u locked in until the timer ran off! good job!). both have different music and dialogue box!
  make sure you reach the good ends heheee!
  ending screen ends with you (the player) thanking Akechi Goro for his precious time and then you return back to homescreen! heheehehhe

-----SUMMARY OF WHAT I LEARNT;

- html: i used the input type range for the first time! input types are reaaally cool!
  i learnt deep about classes and id's and how much they really matter T-T (i didnt knew that i barely knew about them in details)
  and most of it was just usual screen planning, i already sketched the layout of how i'd like the app to look like and implemented it like that.
  i also learnt how to add music in your code better behehe 

- css; i first did the styling with random colorful rectangled that i used as placeholders cuz i was worried that what if i made my assets and they just dont implement in, id start crying so to prevent that, i made the full layout with colorful placeholders!
  (everything is ok with css EXCEPT SOMETIMES IT JUST DOESNT LISTEN TO ME WHEN I WANT TO CENTER THAT ONE BUTTON LIKE U WORK FOR EVERYONE WHY THIS ONE) (its ok i force it tho) (but still ARGHHH)

- JS; here comes the main part. yes. oh my God DONT LET ME GET STARTED. IT WAS MAD FRUSTRATION MAKING THIS. I RESEARCHED SO MUCH. LIKE SO SO SO MUCH. like yeah it might be easier for other people BUT IT WASNT FOR ME.
  AND ALL THE AI BOTS ARE USELESS. all i could ask them for help was what this thing do, how does this work. i swear i almost cried because the functions TOOK SO LONG to work. i modified them LITERALLY FOR LIKE 100+ TIMES so that they will finally work.
  I LEARNT SO SOS OSOSOSOSOSOO MUCH FROM THIS. that im scared of js for now but... (Its better than my last project...) (oh the war flashbacks..) but yeah i cant explain everything in detail, but id say the most tricky part was that every screen has its own different and special features that took me so long to understand. but i get the gist of it! (i think)..

- overall, ive wrote too much idk if anyone even read it to the end here but Thank you for reading this, last but not the least, id like to say i really like my silly lil web app, im definitely gonna use it to stay locked in ( iam actually using it rn)
  i made all the assets myself, illustrations and then animating them, then making the home page animations, and other layouts, and ui ux stuff. it look me whole 7 days to finish this. im reeaally proud of it. i hope whoever tried it likes it too..
  its actually one of my first projects so i was really nervous about it but.. haha Bismillah T-T (oh yeah i might be forgetting some more features in there but yeah lets see if u can spot them out!)
